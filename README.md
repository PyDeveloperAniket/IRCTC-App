# IRCTC-App

This program uses the `Scanner` class to take user input, and it displays a menu of options to the user. Depending on the user's choice, it prompts for additional information such as train name, number of seats, class of travel, booking ID, PNR number, or transaction ID. It then displays the relevant information to the user.

Overall, the program seems to be a simple command-line interface for a railway booking system, allowing users to book tickets, check their bookings, inquire about their PNR number or transaction ID, and cancel tickets. The program does not actually implement any of these functionalities, but it provides a framework that can be extended to add more features.
